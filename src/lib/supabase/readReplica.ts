/**
 * Read-replica aware Supabase client.
 *
 * Supabase Pro projects can have one or more read replicas in additional
 * regions. The replicas expose the same Postgres schema (eventually
 * consistent — typically <1s lag) and accept the *same* service-role key
 * as the primary. They're a free win for:
 *
 *   - Anonymous public pages (e.g. `/v/[vin]`, `/c/[public_id]`) where
 *     freshness of <1s lag is fine and the request rate is unpredictable
 *   - Dashboard summary queries that scan large tables (the primary should
 *     keep its capacity for writes from POS / certificate issuance)
 *   - Cron jobs that compute aggregates / reports
 *
 * Operational notes:
 *   - The replica is **read-only**. Any write attempt will throw at the
 *     PG layer. Helpers here therefore typed-narrow to remove `insert` /
 *     `update` / `delete` / `rpc` from the returned shape — this is
 *     intentional, the runtime error would be late and confusing.
 *   - When `SUPABASE_REPLICA_URL` is unset (most local / staging envs),
 *     `getReadReplica()` returns the primary admin client. Callers do
 *     NOT need to branch — it's a transparent fallback so we can ship
 *     replica-aware code well before Pro replicas are provisioned.
 *
 * Env:
 *   SUPABASE_REPLICA_URL = the replica endpoint
 *                          (e.g. https://<id>-replica.supabase.co)
 *                          falls back to NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL when unset.
 *   SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY is reused as the auth key (same role on replica).
